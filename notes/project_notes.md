# Project Notes

## Open questions
- Does a user agent need to be added to prevent any kind of exceptions? If a user agent is required, this link may be helpful for selecting a user agent: https://techblog.willshouse.com/2012/01/03/most-common-user-agents/



## Next steps
- Replace print statements with logging.
- Current design will take over 72 hours (3 days) to scape all 228k images. Implement multiprocessing to reduce this time. Until multiprocessing is implemented, images will not be downloaded in final script.
